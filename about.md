RodentBin is the Fuel Rats' in-house text uploader!
It's open to everyone, but RodentBin is primarily focused towards the needs of 
The Mischief.

While pastes never automatically expire, Pastes may be deleted at any time, and with 
no prior notice. Please refrain from using RodentBin as a file host or as data
storage for this reason.

## Usage

1. Type up or paste in existing text to the editor.
2. Click "Save" (the floppy icon, farthest left of the buttons).
3. Copy the URL in your address bar.
5. ??????
6. Profit!

To make a new entry, click "New" (or type 'control + n')

## Privacy

While the contents of paste.fuelrats.com are not directly crawled by any search robot
that obeys "robots.txt", there should be no great expectation of privacy.  Post
things at your own risk. Not responsible for any loss of data or removed
pastes.

## Open Source

Haste can easily be installed behind your network, and it's all open source!
